							<h3>Never lose what you copied</h3>
							<p>Clipger solves several problems related to the
							clipboard: One of them is that you sometimes copy something that you
							look for again a few days later. With clipger you can just
							search for these things in the clipboard history and
							easily find them.</p>

							<h3>Smart previews</h3>
							<p>Clipger will intelligently show you previews for things like YouTube links. Want to quickly find a video URL you recently copied? No problem.</p>
							<p>There are previews for image links, YouTube,
							Imgur, Giphy, 9gag and generic previews for all
							other websites.

							<h3>Privacy options</h3>
							<p>Privacy options were a central design aspect of
							clipger from the very beginning. By default clipger
							won't save any information that was marked as
							sensible by another application, password managers
							like 1Password usually do this.</p>
							<p>There's also a private mode where clipger won't
							record anything. It can also be enabled
							for the next minute using a keyboard shortcut. Other
							than that you can blacklist applications that
							clipger should ignore and you can easily batch delete old
							history or specific history entries.</p>

							<h3>Powerful clipboard manipulation</h3>
							<p>Clipger has a lot of helper functionality to let
							you be more productive using the clipboard. You can
							append to the current clipboard entry using the
							shortcut <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.</p>
							<p>There are also
							<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> and <kbd>cmd</kbd> +
							<kbd>g</kbd> to paste the next
							or previous history entry. You can use these to cycle
							through your clipboard history.</p>
							<p>Using clipger's GUI you can apply filters on
							history entries. For example you remove trailing
							whitespace or capitalize all words.</p>

							<h3>Rich text support</h3>
							<p>Clipger is smart enough to detect if the copied
							text had rich formating. In these cases clipger will
							offer you a plain text and a rich text preview.</p>
							<p>You can also choose to copy or paste either the plain or
							the rich text version. By default clipger will
							always preserve the original formating.</p>
