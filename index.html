							<h3>Never lose what you once copied</h3>
							<p>Clipger solves several problems related to the
							clipboard: One of them is that you sometimes copy something that you
							look for again a few days later. With clipger you can just
							search for these things in the clipboard history and
							easily find them.</p>
							<p>Just press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> and
							clipger will open in a <span class="gallery-link"
									data-i="0">Spotlight like floating
									window</span> and let you search through your clipboard
							history.</p>
						</div>
				</li>

					<div class="container">

						<div class="description">
							<h3>Smart previews</h3>
							<p>Clipger will intelligently show you previews for things like YouTube links. Want to quickly find a video URL you recently copied? No problem.</p>
							<p>There are previews for image links, YouTube,
							Imgur, Giphy, 9gag and generic previews for all
							other websites.

							<h3>Privacy options</h3>
							<p>Privacy options were a central design aspect of
							clipger from the very beginning. By default clipger
							won't save any information that was marked as
							confidential by another application, password managers
							like 1Password usually do this.</p>
							<p>There's also a private mode where clipger won't
							record anything. It can also be enabled
							for only the next minute using the keyboard shortcut
							<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd>.</p>
							<p>Other than that you can blacklist applications that
							clipger should ignore, can easily batch delete old
							history or specific history entries and can configure
							for how long clipger should save history in general.</p>

						<div class="description">
							<h3>Powerful clipboard manipulation</h3>
							<p>Clipger has a lot of helper functionality to let
							you be more productive when using the clipboard. You can
							append to the current clipboard entry using the
							shortcut <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.</p>
							<p>There are also
							<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> and <kbd>cmd</kbd> +
							<kbd>g</kbd> to paste the next
							or previous history entry. You can use these to cycle
							through your clipboard history.</p>
							<p>When wanting to copy or paste in clipger's GUI you can apply <span
		   class="gallery-link" data-i="3">filters</span> on
							history entries. For example to remove trailing
							whitespace or capitalize all words.</p>

							<h3>Support for rich text formatting</h3>
							<p>Clipger is smart enough to detect if the copied
							text had rich formating. In these cases clipger will
							offer you a plain text and a rich text preview.</p>
							<p>You can also choose to copy or paste either the plain or
							the rich text version. By default clipger will
							always preserve the original formating.</p>

				<h3>Overview over all features</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Advanced search</h4>
						<p>Clipger let's you do <span class="gallery-link"
									data-i="7">fuzzy searching</span>, i.e. it doesn't expect
						the words in your search query to be in the right order.
						However there's also an <span class="gallery-link"
									data-i="2">advanced search mode</span> that allows
						you to filter by app and time frame</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Unlimited history</h4>
						<p>Unlike other apps clipger let's you save history for
						however long you want and as many history entries as you
						want. By default this means that you're history size is
						unlimited. There are also <span class="gallery-link"
									  data-i="13">options to set limits</span></p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Have common information quickly accessible</h4>
						<p>It's pretty annoying to type out common information like
						your e-mail adress. With clipger you can just search for
						the first few characters and then let clipger paste it into the front app</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Append to the clipboard</h4>
						<p>Clipger gives you the keyboard shortcut
						<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to directly
						append the selected text to the clipboard. You can even
						configure with what characters to combine the current
						clipboard entry and the appended text</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Manipulate the clipboard entry</h4>
						<p>You can apply several <span class="gallery-link"
									 data-i="3">filters</span> before clipger will
						copy or paste the selected history entry. For example
						you can let clipger trim whitespace or make it
						capitalize parts of the text</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Private mode</h4>
						<p>Want Clipger to temporarely stop saving your
						clipboard history? There's a private mode for just that.
						Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd> to enable it just
						for the next 60 seconds</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Ignores passwords</h4>
						<p>By default Clipger will ignore all clipboard entries
						that were marked as confidential by another application.
						E.g. everything that 1Password writes into the clipboard
						won't be saved by clipger</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Paste into Front app</h4>
						<p>When in clipger's main window you can press
						<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> to paste the selected
						history entry right into the front app. Press only
						<kbd>enter</kbd> and clipger will just copy to the
						clipboard</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Preserves text type</h4>
						<p>Clipger has no problems dealing with different types
						of text, like e.g. text with formating. If you let
						clipger paste an old history entry it will preverse the
						text type by default</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Configurable keyboard shortcuts</h4>
						<p>Cliper offers a bunch of global keyboard shortcuts
						but you can <span class="gallery-link" data-i="14">configure</span> all of them however you'd like</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Paste next/prev functionality</h4>
						<p>Inspired by Vim's YankRing plugin clipger offers
						global keyboard shortcuts to paste the next or previous
						item from your clipboard history. Want to paste something
						you copied a while ago? Just press the "next" keyboard
						shortcut several times</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Dark and light modes</h4>
						<p>Clipger has a dark and a light mode, just like OS
						X. You can also choose to always use the same mode as OS
						X itself</p>
					</li>
